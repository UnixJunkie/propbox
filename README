                      propbox 0.5

Summary
=======

Propbox is a Python package for computing molecular properties and
models, and handing the dependencies between the calculations.

The dependencies form a workflow. For example, the steps in building a
consensus model may look like this:

  - the input is a SMILES string
  - turn the SMILES into a molecule
  - desalt it and standardize the charge model
  - use the clean molecule to compute logP,
      molecular weight, and a few other desciptors
  - use the descriptors to compute model-1,
      model-2, and model-3
  - use model-1, model-2, and model-3 to compute
      a consensus model

Rather than arrange the steps by hand, propbox uses a set of resolvers
to fill out a table of properties. The table starts with the input
data - one row per record. You ask the table for the output columns
you want. If a property isn't available, the table asks the resolver
to fill in the missing column. That operation may require additional
data, in which case the resolver goes back to the table to ask for
those columns. This process continues recursively until it gets to
available data. (Or if there's a cycle, until Python's reaches its
maximum recursion depth and throws an exception.) Each resolver then
resolves the column data and the process unwinds until all of the
needed columns are filled in.
